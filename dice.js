/* Hello There Padawan,
    Your challenge for today is to create a dice battle game where a player will face a computer.
    Each round the player and computer will roll 5 dice
    The sum of the dice rolls will be calculated
    A winner, or a Tie will be declared based on who has the Highest Score
    
    Make sure you use npm install as well as npm install -D vitest before you start
    check the test file to see the names of the functions and variables that you will need to use
    Make sure you write export before your function names to test them.
